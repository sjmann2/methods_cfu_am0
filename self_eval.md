# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
- **I feel pretty good using built in ruby methods. I am able to test them out and look them up when I can't figure it out on my own**
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
- **When I started I didn't feel super confident but by the end of the exercises I felt like I had gained a better grasp on them.**
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
- **I have general questions on a real life example of when a method would be useful or when you would want to create your own method. How often does a programming create a method? Is it an every day type of thing?**
